# AI SURVIVORS — Project Overview

A multiplayer Vampire Survivors parody. Up to 8 players share one screen (laptop/TV) and control their characters from their phones via a virtual joystick over local WiFi. Theme: software engineers fighting feature requests, bugs, managers, and ultimately AI itself.

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js (ESM, `"type": "module"`)
- **Server deps**: `ws` only — no framework
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML5 Canvas + ES Modules, no build step
- **Start**: `npm start` → `node server.js`

```

### Server (`server.js`)
- Dumb relay — no game state server-side
- HTTP: serves `public/` as static files with MIME types
- WebSocket routes:
  - `/game` → game screen (one connection)
  - `/controller` → phone controllers (up to 8)
- Assigns player IDs (0–7), forwards input to game screen, state back to phones
- Detects local IP and prints game + controller URLs on start

### Game Screen
- All game logic runs in the browser
- `main.js` owns the game loop (`requestAnimationFrame`), imports all modules
- Camera tracks centroid of alive players (smooth lerp)
- Keyboard fallback: press **Space** to add debug player, **WASD/arrows** to move, **Enter** to start

### Phone Controller
- Connects to `/controller`, receives assigned player ID
- Touch joystick sends `{type:"input", dx, dy}` at ~30 Hz
- Displays HP bar, XP bar, level
- On level-up: joystick replaced by 3 tappable upgrade buttons
- Screen wake lock via `navigator.wakeLock`

## Networking Protocol

| Direction | Message | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Phone → Game | `{type:"input", playerId, dx, dy}` | 30 Hz |
| Game → All phones | `{type:"state", players:[...]}` | 5 Hz |
| Game → Specific phone | `{type:"upgrade_prompt", targetPlayer, options}` | on level-up |
| Phone → Game | `{type:"upgrade_pick", upgradeId}` | upgrade selection |
| Phone → Game | `{type:"request_start"}` | start from phone |
| Game → All phones | `{type:"game_start"}` / `{type:"game_over", victory, stats}` | flow events |
| Server → Game | `{type:"player_joined/left", playerId}` | connection events |

---

## Game Loop (`main.js`)

Each frame:
1. **Pause check** — if any player has `pendingUpgrade`, skip simulation, render with pause overlay
2. Player `update(dt)` — apply joystick input, move, update duck orbit angle
3. Soft player-player collision (push apart)
4. Coffee aura boost (temporarily bumps `fireRateMultiplier`)
5. `updateWeapons(dt, player, projectiles, enemies)` for each player
6. Rubber duck contact damage check
7. Enemy update — frozen timer, then type-specific AI
8. Projectile update + enemy collision detection
9. Enemy-player contact damage
10. XP gem magnet + collection → level-up trigger
11. `WaveManager.update()` — timer, spawn new enemies
12. Cleanup dead entities
13. Game-over check (all dead / boss defeated)
14. Camera update + render
15. Broadcast state to phones (5 Hz)

---

## Entities

### Player
- `id`, `color`, `name`, `x/y`, `dx/dy` (joystick input), `facingX/Y`
- Stats: `speed=150`, `radius=14`, `hp/maxHp=100`, `pickupRadius=50`
- Multipliers: `damageMultiplier`, `fireRateMultiplier`, `aoeMultiplier`
- `bonusPierce` — added to all projectile pierce values
- `weapons[]` — array of `{type, cooldown}` objects
- `pendingUpgrade` — true while waiting for upgrade pick (pauses game)
- `invincibleTimer` — brief i-frames after taking damage (0.3s)

### Enemy Types

| Type | HP | Speed | Notes |
|------|----|-------|-------|
| `jira` | 15 | 60 | Basic walker |
| `bug` | 10 | 110 | Zigzag movement |
| `feature` | 40 | 40 | Splits into 2 JIRAs on death |
| `merge` | 80 | 30 | Tanky |
| `flaky` | 12 | 50 | Teleports every 2s |
| `pm` | 150 | 35 | Elite — spawns JIRA tickets every 4s |
| `em` | 200 | 30 | Elite — pulls players every 5s |
| `vp` | 300 | 25 | Elite — shuffles player positions + spawns minions |
| `boss` | 2000+ | 20 | 3 phases (see below) |

### Boss — THE AI (wave 20)
- **Phase 1** (>66% HP): spawns enemy clusters every 4s
- **Phase 2** (33–66%): hallucination — spawns 4 flaky enemies every 1.5s
- **Phase 3** (<33%): rearranges player positions, spawns bugs every 2s, speed bumps to 35

### Projectile
- `vx/vy`, `damage`, `pierce` (decrements per hit), `hitEnemies` Set
- `isAOE` flag — AOE projectiles check radius instead of point collision
- `homing` flag — hotfix projectiles steer toward nearest enemy

### XPGem
- Magnets toward nearest player within `pickupRadius`
- Collected on overlap

## Weapons

All defined in `WEAPON_DEFS` in `weapons.js`. Each has `cooldown`, `damage`, `speed`, `pierce`, and a `fire(player, projectiles, enemies)` method.

| Weapon | Cooldown | Behavior |
|--------|----------|----------|
| `code_review` | 0.5s | Fires in facing direction, pierces 1 |
| `stackoverflow` | 1.2s | 4 cardinal direction projectiles |
| `git_revert` | 3s | AOE pulse (radius 80), hits all in range |
| `rubber_duck` | passive | Orbits player at r=50, contact damage |
| `unit_test` | 0.15s | Fast forward volley with slight spread |
| `hotfix` | 2s | Slow homing projectile, high damage |
| `coffee` | passive | Aura — +30% fire rate to nearby allies |
| `standup` | 8s | Freezes all enemies within r=120 for 2s |

All players start with `code_review`. Additional weapons are gained via the "Learn a new framework" upgrade.

Cooldown is divided by `player.fireRateMultiplier`. Pierce is summed with `player.bonusPierce`.

---

## Wave Progression (`waves.js`)

- **WaveManager** ticks every 30s, `currentWave` 1–20
- Each tick: spawn `min(2 + wave/2, 8)` enemies + elite check
- Elite spawns: PM at wave 5+, EM at wave 8+, VP at wave 12+
- Boss spawns once at wave 20 (`bossSpawned` flag)
- Enemy type pool expands: bugs (w4), features (w5), merges (w8), flakies (w12)
- Spawn position: random angle, 500–700px from player centroid (off-screen)
- All stats scale by `1 + (wave - 1) * 0.05`

---

## Upgrades (`upgrades.js`)

`rollUpgrades(3)` picks 3 random from pool. `applyUpgrade(player, id)` applies effect.

| ID | Name | Effect |
|----|------|--------|
| `new_weapon` | "Learn a new framework" | Adds a random unowned weapon |
| `damage` | "Senior engineer review" | `damageMultiplier += 0.2` |
| `speed` | "Agile methodology" | `speed *= 1.15` |
| `hp` | "Work-life balance" | `maxHp += 25`, full heal |
| `fire_rate` | "Caffeinated" | `fireRateMultiplier += 0.2` |
| `pickup` | "Networking skills" | `pickupRadius *= 1.5` |
| `pierce` | "Vertical slice" | `bonusPierce += 1` |
| `aoe` | "Scope creep" | `aoeMultiplier += 0.25` |

XP formula: `xpToNext = 10 + level * 5`

---

## Rendering (`renderer.js`)

- Camera: smooth lerp toward player centroid
- Screen shake: intensity + timer, applied as random translate offset
- Floating texts: world-space, rise + fade over ~0.8s
- Sprites: programmatic pixel art cached to offscreen canvases (`sprites.js`)
- HUD: wave/time top-left, engineer count top-right, mini HP bars per player
- Pause overlay: semi-transparent black + "LEVEL UP!" + player name/color

---

## Humor / Flavor

- **Wave messages**: "Sprint 5 begins... The backlog grows."
- **Damage text**: `-42 LOC deleted`
- **Death messages**: "Mass-laid-off", "PR rejected by the universe", "Segfault in production"
- **Player names**: "Junior Dev", "The Intern", "Staff Engineer", "10x Engineer", etc.
- **Victory**: "You have been... not replaced. For now."
- **Game over**: "Your job is safe... until the next reorg."
- **Upgrade names**: "Learn a new framework", "Work-life balance", "Agile methodology"

## Known Gaps / Future Work

- No actual QR code (shows URL as text instead — needs a QR library or pre-generated image)
- No arena boundaries — world is infinite
- Debug player (id: -1) auto-picks first upgrade after 1s
- No persistent scores / leaderboard
- No sound for wave start beyond wave 1
